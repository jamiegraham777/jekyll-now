My dream is to use engineering and software to not only inspire new technologies, but to inspire people.

### Introduction

Hello World! My name is Jamie Graham and I am an aspiring software engineer and entrepreneur. I'm an 18 year old high school valedictorian and rising Computer Science major at Oregon State University Honors College. I am NCWIT Aspirations in Computing National Winner, Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Scholar, Engineering & Aerospace Sciences Academy Scholar, and FIRST Robotics Alumni.

I am a rising software developer and digital marketing intern at 24Notion where I can integrate my STEM experience to provide enriching promotional experience for 24Notion's global community of clients. In the past, I was project manager and software engineer FIRST intern for 2 years at Autodesk Inc. where I lead production of open-source FIRST Robotics simulator Synthesis which maps a student's Java and C++ code to CAD designs.

In High School, I was Lead Programmer of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 4043 NerdHerd where I designed and programmed complex robots to solve challenges. I also designed and programmed 2 Nanoracks Nanolab experiments that were tested on the International Space Station. Most recently, I also launched our school's Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam program where I invented a better shelter for diaster refugees in developing nations. I completed several Project Lead The Way (PLTW) courses as well as college credit Computer Science and math courses. I was also President of my school's Engineering program, Captain of Fellowship of Christian Athletes, National Honor Society Member, and a leader in KidCo Productions.

During high school, I have had many mentors foster my passion for STEM and give me the tools I needed to succeed. I am a huge believer in giving back to rising students, especially girls, in STEM and helping others succeed just others have helped me. I am an avid FIRST Robotics Volunteer and promoter for STEM/ CS in education.
